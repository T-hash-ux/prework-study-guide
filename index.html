        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for tracking changes in source code during software development.</li>
          <li>Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and keep track of changes made by each developer.</li>
          <li>Git allows you to revert to previous versions of the code and collaborate with others on the same project.</li>
          <li>Git has three main components: repository (a place to store all files and changes), working directory (a copy of the files on your local machine), and stage (a place to prepare changes for a commit).</li>
          <li>Git commands: clone (create a local copy of a remote repository), add (add changes to the stage), commit (save changes to the repository), push (send changes to a remote repository), pull (receive changes from a remote repository), etc.</li>
          <li>Git branching allows multiple developers to work on different features of the same project simultaneously. The master branch is the default branch, and new branches can be created for specific features.</li>
          <li>Git merge is used to combine changes from different branches into a single branch. Git merge conflicts occur when the same lines of code have been changed in different branches.</li>

          <li>JavaScript has six primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, and Symbol.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li>we use an assignment operator "=" to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
